# Fast-OFDM-with-Index-Modulation-MATLAB-Simulation

# Overview

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation of Fast Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation (Fast-OFDM-IM), a next-generation waveform combining Fast-OFDM and subcarrier index modulation to improve significantly spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and bandwidth utilization.

Fast-OFDM allows subcarriers to be packed more tightly using a non-orthogonal basis (e.g., using Discrete Cosine Transform - DCT), and Index Modulation encodes additional bits in the indices of active subcarriers, rather than only the signal constellation.
